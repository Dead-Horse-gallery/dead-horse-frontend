# Dead Horse Gallery - Enhanced AuthContext with Soft Account Gating

## Overview

I've successfully created an enhanced AuthContext system for Dead Horse Gallery that implements **soft account gating** - a user-friendly progressive authentication strategy that allows guests to explore the gallery while strategically prompting them to create accounts.

## Key Features Implemented

### 1. Enhanced AuthContext (`src/contexts/AuthContext.tsx`)

**Core Authentication States:**
- `guest` - Anonymous browsing with limited permissions
- `email` - Email-authenticated users via Magic.link
- `wallet` - Wallet-connected users (MetaMask, WalletConnect)
- `hybrid` - Users with both email and wallet authentication

**Soft Gating Capabilities:**
- Guest interaction tracking (views, searches, saves, etc.)
- Intelligent authentication prompts based on usage patterns
- Progressive permission enhancement
- Flexible authentication upgrade paths

**Key Methods:**
```typescript
// Track user interactions without requiring auth
trackGuestInteraction(action: string, metadata?: Record<string, unknown>)

// Check if auth prompt should be shown based on interaction thresholds
shouldShowAuthPrompt(action: string): boolean

// Permission checking with graceful degradation
hasPermission(permission: string): boolean

// Require authentication with contextual modal
requireAuth(intent: string, redirectTo?: string): boolean

// Progressive upgrade methods
upgradeToEmail(email: string): Promise<boolean>
upgradeToWallet(address: string): Promise<boolean>
upgradeToHybrid(email: string, address: string): Promise<boolean>
```

### 2. Smart Interaction Thresholds

The system uses intelligent thresholds to determine when to prompt for authentication:

```typescript
const thresholds: Record<string, number> = {
  'view_artwork': 5,      // After viewing 5 artworks
  'save_artwork': 1,      // Immediately on save attempt
  'purchase': 1,          // Immediately on purchase attempt
  'contact_artist': 1,    // Immediately on contact attempt
  'comment': 1,           // Immediately on comment attempt
  'share': 3,             // After 3 shares
  'search': 10,           // After 10 searches
  'filter': 8,            // After 8 filters applied
};
```

### 3. Enhanced Gallery Integration (`src/app/gallery/page.tsx`)

**Soft Gating Implementation:**
- Artwork viewing tracking with progressive prompts
- Search behavior monitoring
- Filter usage tracking
- Save/like functionality with immediate auth requirements
- Contextual authentication modals with customized messaging

**User Experience Flow:**
1. **Guest Browsing**: Users can freely explore artworks, search, and filter
2. **Progressive Prompting**: After reaching interaction thresholds, users see friendly prompts
3. **Contextual Messaging**: Each prompt includes specific benefits for that action
4. **Graceful Degradation**: All core browsing functionality remains available

### 4. Existing Component Integration

**ProtectedRoute Component**: Already created for pages requiring full authentication
**LoginModal Component**: Enhanced to work with soft gating contextual messages
**Artwork Detail Pages**: Ready for soft gating integration

## Benefits of This Implementation

### For Users:
- **Non-intrusive**: Can explore the gallery without immediate registration pressure
- **Contextual**: Authentication prompts appear when they add genuine value
- **Progressive**: Can upgrade authentication level as needed
- **Flexible**: Multiple authentication options (email, wallet, hybrid)

### For the Business:
- **Higher Conversion**: Users experience value before being asked to register
- **Better Engagement**: Track user interests and preferences before account creation
- **Reduced Friction**: No authentication barriers for initial discovery
- **Data Collection**: Understand user behavior patterns for optimization

### For Developers:
- **Maintainable**: Clean separation of concerns with context-based state management
- **Extensible**: Easy to add new interaction tracking and thresholds
- **Type-Safe**: Full TypeScript support with comprehensive interfaces
- **Testable**: Modular design with clear method boundaries

## Usage Examples

### Basic Soft Gating
```tsx
const { trackGuestInteraction, shouldShowAuthPrompt, showAuthModal } = useAuth();

// Track user interaction
const handleArtworkView = (artworkId: number) => {
  trackGuestInteraction('view_artwork', { artworkId });
  
  if (shouldShowAuthPrompt('view_artwork')) {
    showAuthModal('continue_browsing', {
      message: 'You\'ve been exploring our gallery! Create an account to save favorites and get personalized recommendations.'
    });
  }
};
```

### Permission-Based Features
```tsx
const { hasPermission, requireAuth } = useAuth();

const handleSaveArtwork = (artworkId: number) => {
  if (!hasPermission('save')) {
    requireAuth('save_artwork', '/artwork/${artworkId}');
    return;
  }
  
  // Proceed with save functionality
  saveArtwork(artworkId);
};
```

### Progressive Authentication
```tsx
const { upgradeToEmail, upgradeToWallet } = useAuth();

// Upgrade guest to email user
const upgradeAccount = async (email: string) => {
  const success = await upgradeToEmail(email);
  if (success) {
    // Show success message and enhanced features
  }
};
```

## Next Steps

The enhanced AuthContext is now ready for integration across the entire application:

1. **Artwork Detail Pages**: Add soft gating for comments, artist contact, sharing
2. **Artist Pages**: Track artist profile views and follow actions  
3. **Purchase Flow**: Implement staged authentication for payment processing
4. **Admin Dashboard**: Monitor interaction patterns and optimize thresholds
5. **Email Marketing**: Use guest interaction data for targeted campaigns

## Technical Notes

- **Compilation**: All components compile without TypeScript errors
- **Dependencies**: Integrates with existing Magic.link and wallet infrastructure
- **Storage**: Uses localStorage for guest interaction persistence
- **Performance**: Lightweight tracking with minimal impact on user experience
- **Security**: Maintains security boundaries while providing guest access

The system successfully balances user experience with business goals, providing a sophisticated yet user-friendly approach to account conversion in the Web3 art gallery context.
